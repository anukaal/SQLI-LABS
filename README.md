# SQLI-LABS

# Introduction:

**Structured Query Language**, also known as **SQL**, is basically a programming language that deals with databases.
For beginners, databases are simply data stores that contain both **client side** and **server side** data. **SQL** manages databases through structured queries, relations, object oriented programming, etc.
Programming geeks will have come across many such types of software, like **MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, and Postgresql**.
These are a few of the programs that give us the capability to manage large databases/data stores through **structured queries**.
The lab we will be using for demonstration is SQLi Labs, which can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/Audi-1/sqli-labs solely for the purpose of studying and making applications safe from such vulnerabilities,
